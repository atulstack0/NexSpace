# NexSpace — State of the Project

*A spatial virtual office (Kumospace-style): walk a 2D/3D floor as an avatar, hear people by proximity, meet in rooms.*

**Repo:** https://github.com/atulstack0/NexSpace · **CI:** GitHub Actions (`check` + `redis-multinode`)
**Last updated:** June 2026

---

## TL;DR

NexSpace is a **working prototype / early MVP**, built on the real production stack and verified end-to-end by CI. Two browser tabs share one office with real-time movement, proximity/room/broadcast spatial audio (real LiveKit voice/video optional), rooms with lockable doors, a synced media wall, a 2D⇄3D view (pseudo-3D + real Three.js WebGL with a PUBG-style camera), presence/status, auth + server-enforced RBAC, recording, a drag-and-drop editor with live reload, analytics, a public API + webhooks + Slack, anti-cheat/rate-limit/connection hardening, and optional Redis multi-node fan-out.

It is **not** a finished SaaS — see "What's not built yet."

## How to run it

Full steps: [`nexspace-scaffold/RUNNING.md`](nexspace-scaffold/RUNNING.md). Quickest path (Windows, no Docker):

```powershell
# API (terminal A) — SQLite, zero external services
cd nexspace-scaffold\apps\api;  npm install; npm run prisma:generate; npm run migrate; npm run seed; npm run dev
# realtime + web (terminal B)
cd nexspace-scaffold\apps\realtime;  npm install; $env:WORLD_API="http://localhost:3001"; npm start
```

Open **http://localhost:8787** in two tabs. Optional: LiveKit Cloud creds in `apps\api\.env` for real voice/video; `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` for Slack; `REDIS_URL` for multi-node.

Verify any change: `cd nexspace-scaffold; npm run check` (also runs in CI on every push).

## What's built (mapped to the plan)

| Area | Status | Where |
|---|---|---|
| 2D world, avatars, WASD + click move, collisions, camera, minimap; **click-to-move now uses A\* nav-grid pathfinding** (BFS + line-of-sight smoothing) that routes around furniture/walls and through open doors | ✅ | `apps/web/index.html` |

| Interactive objects — sticky notes, embeds (YouTube/Spotify/web → iframe), shared countdown timers; placed in the editor, synced live | ✅ | `apps/api` (widget objects), realtime, web, editor |
| Responsive UI — **game-style HUD with vertical side rails** (identity/nav docked down the left edge, grouped control modules down the right edge, scene open in the middle; dark-glass panels, amber hover-glow, blue active states, tactical diamond reticle; right rail clears the minimap; reverts to a horizontal wrap on mobile), collapsible (hamburger), with an **auto-hide toggle** (📌) that slides the rails to the screen edge and reveals them on hover (desktop, persisted). **All overlays** (chat, TV, rooms, customize, activity, mini-game, whiteboard, toasts, minimap, knock/react bars) share one dark-glass theme — amber underline, soft entrance animation, themed scrollbars, focus rings | ✅ | `apps/web/index.html` |
| Accessibility (§7) — every toolbar button now carries a **visible text label** (Sound/Mic/Camera/Devices/Analytics/Chat/Whiteboard/React/Activity/Game…) **and** a hover tooltip; keyboard focus-visible outlines on all controls, screen-reader `aria-label`s mirrored from tooltips, control rails marked up as `toolbar`s, the world canvas labelled + focusable, and a polite `aria-live` region that announces toasts/status | ✅ | `apps/web/index.html` |

| Branding / white-label — per-space name, accent color, logo; served in world + applied live | ✅ | `apps/api` (Floor.branding), realtime, web |
| CI — GitHub Actions (`check` + `redis-multinode` + `api-smoke`) | ✅ | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` |
| Live debug logs — every server `console.*` is mirrored into a 500-entry ring buffer, **appended to a dated log file** (`LOG_DIR/nexspace-YYYY-MM-DD.log`, downloadable via the viewer's ⤓ button or `/logs/download`), + streamed (SSE) to a **/logs.html** viewer (level filter, text search, pause/auto-scroll, clear); **browser errors + key client events** are forwarded over the socket and shown as `[client:<name>]`; plus targeted structured logs for floor edits and AI calls; an **admin-only 📜 Logs toolbar button** opens it one-click (the stream authorizes via the admin's own JWT from localStorage, like `/analytics`); also token-gated via `LOGS_TOKEN` / localhost for CLI use | ✅ | realtime `/logs/stream`+`/logs/recent` + `clientlog`, `apps/web/logs.html` |

## What's not built yet (the honest list)

- **Remote screen control** — not in the build. (Chat covers nearby / floor / #channels / DMs; whiteboard is collaborative.)
- **glTF art** — 3D uses primitives (boxes/cylinders/billboards), not modeled assets.
- _Chai stall is now built_ (rooftop ☕ stall + seating + sip-chai emote). In-world mini-games beyond tic-tac-toe are still open.
- **Calendar / Teams** (need OAuth + accounts) and **SCIM** auto-provisioning.
- **AI** recording transcription (Whisper/Deepgram) — the in-office **assistant + auto meeting-notes + greeter NPC are built**; deep transcription of recordings is not (needs a speech-to-text service). **Native mobile/desktop apps** (web is responsive), **SOC2/GDPR/HIPAA** compliance.
- _All code-only backlog items are now built._ Remaining items need external services/accounts/assets/infra: Calendar/Teams/Zapier integrations, SAML/SCIM, recording transcription, native desktop/mobile apps, full glTF art, SOC2/GDPR/HIPAA, 1,000+ load test.
- **Scale follow-ups**: spatial-hash interest management, Redis-persisted boot state.

## Architecture (as built)

```
Browser (React-free single-file client: 2D canvas / Three.js WebGL / Web Audio)
   │ REST                │ WebSocket                  │ WebRTC
   ▼                     ▼                            ▼
NestJS API (3001)   Realtime server (8787)        LiveKit SFU (optional)
 Prisma/SQLite      authoritative state, RBAC,
 auth, world,       presence, rooms/doors, media,
 layout, egress,    analytics, public API+webhooks,
 livekit tokens     hardening, Redis fan-out (opt)
```

- **View-agnostic state**: the same `(x,y)` world drives the 2D, pseudo-3D, and Three.js renderers — flipping views never touches state, audio, or media.
- **Server-authoritative**: positions are speed-clamped; permissions enforced server-side; clients can't be trusted.

## What CI proves (`npm run check` + jobs)

- **verify**: syntax of the realtime server + both client pages, and the API TypeScript build.
- **smoke** (single process, 21 assertions): join/roles, position sync, status sync + validation, RBAC (recording/doors/reload), live world reload, analytics gating, public API key gating, HMAC webhook + Slack, anti-teleport clamp, rate limiting, connection cap.
- **redis-multinode** (Redis service + 2 nodes): cross-node presence + cross-node door propagation.

> Not covered by CI: the **WebGL/Three.js visuals** (need a real browser) and **real LiveKit media** (need a server). Verify those by eye in the browser.

---

## Roadmap (suggested order)

1. **glTF asset pipeline** for the 3D view (biggest visual upgrade; needs art).
2. **Text chat + screenshare** in the multiplayer client (LiveKit already supports screenshare).
3. **Calendar/Teams/SSO** (OAuth) — needs accounts; CI can cover wiring only.
4. **Scale**: interest management + Redis-persisted shared state on boot.
5. **AI layer**, mobile/desktop apps, compliance — later phases.
