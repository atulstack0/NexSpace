# NexSpace — State of the Project

*A spatial virtual office (Kumospace-style): walk a 2D/3D floor as an avatar, hear people by proximity, meet in rooms.*

**Repo:** https://github.com/atulstack0/NexSpace · **CI:** GitHub Actions (`check` + `redis-multinode`)
**Last updated:** June 2026

---

## TL;DR

NexSpace is a **working prototype / early MVP**, built on the real production stack and verified end-to-end by CI. Two browser tabs share one office with real-time movement, proximity/room/broadcast spatial audio (real LiveKit voice/video optional), rooms with lockable doors, a synced media wall, a 2D⇄3D view (pseudo-3D + real Three.js WebGL with a PUBG-style camera), presence/status, auth + server-enforced RBAC, recording, a drag-and-drop editor with live reload, analytics, a public API + webhooks + Slack, anti-cheat/rate-limit/connection hardening, and optional Redis multi-node fan-out.

It is **not** a finished SaaS — see "What's not built yet."

## How to run it

Full steps: [`nexspace-scaffold/RUNNING.md`](nexspace-scaffold/RUNNING.md). Quickest path (Windows, no Docker):

```powershell
# API (terminal A) — SQLite, zero external services
cd nexspace-scaffold\apps\api;  npm install; npm run prisma:generate; npm run migrate; npm run seed; npm run dev
# realtime + web (terminal B)
cd nexspace-scaffold\apps\realtime;  npm install; $env:WORLD_API="http://localhost:3001"; npm start
```

Open **http://localhost:8787** in two tabs. Optional: LiveKit Cloud creds in `apps\api\.env` for real voice/video; `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` for Slack; `REDIS_URL` for multi-node.

Verify any change: `cd nexspace-scaffold; npm run check` (also runs in CI on every push).

## What's built (mapped to the plan)

| Area | Status | Where |
|---|---|---|
| 2D world, avatars, WASD + click move, collisions, camera, minimap; **click-to-move now uses A\* nav-grid pathfinding** (BFS + line-of-sight smoothing) that routes around furniture/walls and through open doors | ✅ | `apps/web/index.html` |

| In-office AI assistant — `@ai <q>` in chat (or 🤖 button): answers, summarizes recent room chat, drafts notes; **free Google Gemini** / Anthropic / OpenAI (or OpenAI-compatible Groq/OpenRouter) via env key, graceful when unset, per-user cooldown. **Built-in no-key commands**: `@ai who's here`, `@ai schedule`, `@ai help`. **Auto meeting-notes** posted when a booking ends (if a key is set). **AI greeter NPC** — DMs each new joiner a contextual welcome (occupancy + tips) from "🤖 Guide" (set `GUIDE_OFF=1` to disable). | ✅ opt-in | realtime `askAssistant`/`postGuide`, web; `AI_ASSISTANT.md` |
| Screen sharing (LiveKit) — publish + multi-share focus viewer; **present-to-room** mode: one presenter's screen auto-enlarges for everyone in their room with a "X is presenting" banner (synced, RBAC member+, auto-stops on leave) | ✅ opt-in | realtime `present`/`unpresent`, `apps/web` |
| Collaborative whiteboard — synced strokes + clear, late-joiner state, cross-node | ✅ | realtime + web |

| 2D ⇄ 3D toggle — pseudo-3D **and** real Three.js WebGL; **view choice persisted** (localStorage) and restored on next visit | ✅ | `apps/web/index.html` |
| 3D scene lighting — gradient sky backdrop + depth fog, warm key + warm rim + cool fill (three-point) so avatars read with dimension; contact-shadow discs under each avatar | ✅ | `apps/web/index.html` (Three3D) |
| 3D furniture props — desks with **lit monitor screens** (bezel + stand + keyboard), **plush couches** (separate seat/back cushions + arms), **fuller, greener plants** (soil + layered foliage), wood tables, chairs, rugs, all by `furniture.kind` | ✅ | `apps/web/index.html` (Three3D `buildProp`) |

| 3D office props — desks (monitor + chair), meeting tables, sofas, plants, chairs, rugs by `furniture.kind`; **sculpted human avatars** — a real 3D head (skin + hair + eyes/brows + jaw, billboarded so the face tracks you) on a tapered suit (jacket torso + lapels, broad shoulders, jacket sleeves with cuffs, skin hands), per-person tint; turns to face walk direction with floating name tags; the live‑video/photo bubble takes over the head when a camera/photo is on; TV overlay perspective-sized + wall-occluded | ✅ | `apps/web/index.html` (Three3D) |
| Real **rigged human GLB** avatar — loaded from a URL at runtime (default: the three.js "Soldier" sample, served with CORS via jsDelivr; `MODEL_URL` swappable to a Ready Player Me `.glb` or local `models/eric.glb`); auto-fits height, plays Idle/Walk clips, subtle per-person tint, **falls back to the sculpted styled avatar** on any load/CORS failure | ✅ | `apps/web/index.html`, `CHARACTER.md` |
| Walk animation — procedural leg/arm swing on the styled avatar when moving; GLB models play embedded **Walk/Idle** clips (AnimationMixer), blended by movement | ✅ | `apps/web/index.html` (Three3D) |

| Invites & guest links + CSV bulk import (admin-minted, time-boxed); **guest weekly time-cap** — unregistered guests get 4h/week (tracked client-side, weekly reset) with low-time warnings + a sign-in/register prompt; members/owners exempt | ✅ | `apps/api/src/auth`, web |
| Recording — 🔴 indicator + LiveKit Egress start/stop | ✅ (egress needs storage) | `apps/api/src/livekit`, realtime, web |

| Public API (`/api/v1`) + HMAC webhooks + Slack notifications | ✅ | realtime; `docs/PUBLIC_API.md`, `docs/INTEGRATIONS.md` |
| Persistence — NestJS API + Prisma (SQLite default, Postgres-ready) | ✅ | `apps/api` |
| Hardening — anti-teleport, rate limit, connection cap, heartbeat, graceful shutdown; client render-loop error guard (a single frame exception logs once and keeps running instead of freezing the canvas) | ✅ | realtime + web |
| Multi-node fan-out (Redis pub/sub) | ✅ opt-in | realtime; `docs/SCALING.md` |
| Multi-floor + portals — independent floors, floor-scoped presence/chat/snapshots, portal travel + floor switcher | ✅ | `apps/api` (Floor/portal objects), realtime, web |
| Interactive objects — sticky notes, embeds (YouTube/Spotify/web → iframe), shared countdown timers; placed in the editor, synced live | ✅ | `apps/api` (widget objects), realtime, web, editor |
| Responsive UI — **game-style HUD with vertical side rails** (identity/nav docked down the left edge, grouped control modules down the right edge, scene open in the middle; dark-glass panels, amber hover-glow, blue active states, tactical diamond reticle; right rail clears the minimap; reverts to a horizontal wrap on mobile), collapsible (hamburger). **All overlays** (chat, TV, rooms, customize, activity, mini-game, whiteboard, toasts, minimap, knock/react bars) share one dark-glass theme — amber underline, soft entrance animation, themed scrollbars, focus rings | ✅ | `apps/web/index.html` |
| Accessibility (§7) — every toolbar button now carries a **visible text label** (Sound/Mic/Camera/Devices/Analytics/Chat/Whiteboard/React/Activity/Game…) **and** a hover tooltip; keyboard focus-visible outlines on all controls, screen-reader `aria-label`s mirrored from tooltips, control rails marked up as `toolbar`s, the world canvas labelled + focusable, and a polite `aria-live` region that announces toasts/status | ✅ | `apps/web/index.html` |
| In-office floor editor — owner/admin drag-move, add, delete furniture + notes/timers/portals live; **multi-select** (Shift-click → group drag/delete), **undo/redo** (Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y + ↶↷ buttons, exact via client-id adds + server `restore` op), **floor layout templates** (office / lounge / classroom / event hall — one-click `Apply layout`, undoable via `setFurniture`), **room-drawing** (▭ Room → drag a rectangle → names a new room zone) **and full room editing** (click a room to select, drag to move — door moves with it — drag the corner/edge **resize handles**, **double-click to rename**, or 🗑 delete; all undoable) **and full wall editing** (▥ Wall → drag to draw a new wall; click a wall to select → drag to move / delete; floor-boundary walls protected); grid-snapped; RBAC-gated; **persists** across restarts (Redis or JSON file) | ✅ | realtime `editFloor` (+`restore`/`template`/`setFurniture`/`addRoom`/`moveRoom`/`resizeRoom`/`renameRoom`/`removeRoom`) + persist, web |
| Branding / white-label — per-space name, accent color, logo; served in world + applied live | ✅ | `apps/api` (Floor.branding), realtime, web |
| CI — GitHub Actions (`check` + `redis-multinode` + `api-smoke`) | ✅ | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` |
| Live debug logs — every server `console.*` is mirrored into a 500-entry ring buffer, **appended to a dated log file** (`LOG_DIR/nexspace-YYYY-MM-DD.log`, downloadable via the viewer's ⤓ button or `/logs/download`), + streamed (SSE) to a **/logs.html** viewer (level filter, text search, pause/auto-scroll, clear); **browser errors + key client events** are forwarded over the socket and shown as `[client:<name>]`; plus targeted structured logs for floor edits and AI calls; an **admin-only 📜 Logs toolbar button** opens it one-click (the stream authorizes via the admin's own JWT from localStorage, like `/analytics`); also token-gated via `LOGS_TOKEN` / localhost for CLI use | ✅ | realtime `/logs/stream`+`/logs/recent` + `clientlog`, `apps/web/logs.html` |

## What's not built yet (the honest list)

- **Remote screen control** — not in the build. (Chat covers nearby / floor / #channels / DMs; whiteboard is collaborative.)
- **glTF art** — 3D uses primitives (boxes/cylinders/billboards), not modeled assets.
- **Outdoor "chai stall"** environment + in-world mini-games. (Multi-floor + portals, and interactive objects — notes, YouTube/Spotify/web embeds, shared timers — are now built.)
- **Calendar / Teams** (need OAuth + accounts) and **SCIM** auto-provisioning.
- **AI** recording transcription (Whisper/Deepgram) — the in-office **assistant + auto meeting-notes + greeter NPC are built**; deep transcription of recordings is not (needs a speech-to-text service). **Native mobile/desktop apps** (web is responsive), **SOC2/GDPR/HIPAA** compliance.
- _All code-only backlog items are now built._ Remaining items need external services/accounts/assets/infra: Calendar/Teams/Zapier integrations, SAML/SCIM, recording transcription, native desktop/mobile apps, full glTF art, SOC2/GDPR/HIPAA, 1,000+ load test.
- **Scale follow-ups**: spatial-hash interest management, Redis-persisted boot state.

## Architecture (as built)

```
Browser (React-free single-file client: 2D canvas / Three.js WebGL / Web Audio)
   │ REST                │ WebSocket                  │ WebRTC
   ▼                     ▼                            ▼
NestJS API (3001)   Realtime server (8787)        LiveKit SFU (optional)
 Prisma/SQLite      authoritative state, RBAC,
 auth, world,       presence, rooms/doors, media,
 layout, egress,    analytics, public API+webhooks,
 livekit tokens     hardening, Redis fan-out (opt)
```

- **View-agnostic state**: the same `(x,y)` world drives the 2D, pseudo-3D, and Three.js renderers — flipping views never touches state, audio, or media.
- **Server-authoritative**: positions are speed-clamped; permissions enforced server-side; clients can't be trusted.

## What CI proves (`npm run check` + jobs)

- **verify**: syntax of the realtime server + both client pages, and the API TypeScript build.
- **smoke** (single process, 21 assertions): join/roles, position sync, status sync + validation, RBAC (recording/doors/reload), live world reload, analytics gating, public API key gating, HMAC webhook + Slack, anti-teleport clamp, rate limiting, connection cap.
- **redis-multinode** (Redis service + 2 nodes): cross-node presence + cross-node door propagation.

> Not covered by CI: the **WebGL/Three.js visuals** (need a real browser) and **real LiveKit media** (need a server). Verify those by eye in the browser.

---

## Roadmap (suggested order)

1. **glTF asset pipeline** for the 3D view (biggest visual upgrade; needs art).
2. **Text chat + screenshare** in the multiplayer client (LiveKit already supports screenshare).
3. **Calendar/Teams/SSO** (OAuth) — needs accounts; CI can cover wiring only.
4. **Scale**: interest management + Redis-persisted shared state on boot.
5. **AI layer**, mobile/desktop apps, compliance — later phases.
